Allan Ambris,"This project was inspired by my experience working with NYC Open Data - NYPD Shooting Incident Data. There were no concerns with the dataset until a chance observation in one of my visualizations. This led to a series of discoveries that began to chip away at the dataset’s influence.

I contrast the findings made before and after some of these discoveries through Data Visualization. It is not intended to guide others in the use of the data. Instead, it’s meant to serve as a reminder and/or warning. It attempts to show the potential impact that accurate data documentation and management practices have on reporting. Even with extreme caution, Data Analysis is at the mercy of the data and the analyst.

Prudence Brou,"The goal of this to project is to provide a resource that will guide users in their decision-making process and ultimately help them navigate the challenges of apartment rental in NYC. As the rising cost of rent can cause a significant source of stress for many New Yorkers, I was committed to help them navigate the challenges and make informed decisions about renting an apartment. The website will be a platform where the users or renters will be able to find extensive information and resources that I compiled to support them.

Kyoung Kang,"This country is suffering from perpetual gun violences, mass shootings, and gun suicides. The nation's ongoing debate over gun controls versus gun ownership rights are ugly conflicts that cost so many innocent lives every single day. While America should work hard to completely abolish its pervasive gun culture deeply rooted in Colonialism, its strategies for reducing gun deaths must be age, gender, race, and community specific. My project is to visualize the U.S. firearm mortality between 2018 and 2021 to uncover answers to the three research questions: What are the main causes of gun death in the U.S.? Do the main causes of gun death differ by age, race, and gender? Are the gun homicides and gun suicides related to poverty rates?",KlaraKang,Page One-KyoungKang (klarakang.github.io),2018-2021 U.S. Firearm Mortality,https://klarakang.github.io/DATA780Final/all.html,,

Alex McGlinchy,"An exploratory visualization of the makeup of the NYPD members of service and the number of complaints against them. My goal for this project was to create an engaging, aesthetically pleasing and highly interactive visualization, allowing the user to explore the data and draw their own conclusions. The data for this project comes from the Civilian Complaint Review Board, made available on NYC OpenData. For my purposes, I’ve only included officers with the status of currently active within the past year, and only those with at least one total substantiated complaint against them. Users can see the number of complaints against each service member and also sort them by race, rank, or gender.",amcglinchy,,NYPD Members of Service,,,
